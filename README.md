- 🏫 Undergraduate in Analysis and System Development at Federal Institute Goiano - Brazil
- 📚

  - I am currently learning about NodeJS, ReactJS, AdonisJS, NestJS, GraphQL, Docker and specially JavaScript.

  - I plan to study about non-relational databases too (like MongoDB), in my whole programming path I have worked only with relational ones, and I think that I have to know the differences and learn when to choose each one.

- 🏢 Intern at Luby Software.
